This is my Final Project of Bano Qabil (CIT with Python) course. This Project implements a simple command-line-based "Digital Diary" application in Python. It allows users to write and save diary updates with timestamps and read previous entries. The application presents a menu with three options: writing a new update, reading diary updates, and exiting the program. Updates are stored in a text file named diary.txt, and the program ensures that diary entries are saved successfully or informs the user if no updates are available. The loop continues until the user decides to exit the program.
